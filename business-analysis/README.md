# IoT-Enabled Fuel Supply Chain Optimization for IOCL (Jabalpur Division)

## üìå Project Overview
This project addresses the **challenges in fuel transportation and replenishment** faced by the IOCL Jabalpur division. The focus is on optimizing the supply chain for fuels such as **XP-95, XP-100, MS, and HSD** through **IoT integration, predictive analytics, and chemical engineering safety measures**.

The system aims to:
- Prevent **fuel stockouts** and **overfilling** at petrol pumps.
- Integrate **real-time communication** between depots, retail outlets, and transport systems.
- Minimize **thermal losses**, **sludge accumulation**, and **contamination risks**.
- Provide an **analytics dashboard** for better decision-making.

## üéØ Business Objectives
- Reduce stockout issues at retail outlets.
- Optimize dispatch scheduling between depots and pumps.
- Implement **IoT-based monitoring** of tank levels and conditions.
- Enhance region-wise visibility of fuel needs.
- Improve engineering processes for fuel storage and handling.

## üîç Current Process & Challenges
1. Fuel arrives at depots via pipelines, rail, or road.
2. Stored in large tanks, separated by fuel type.
3. SAP used for PO generation and scheduling truck loading.
4. Dispatch based on **manual estimation** (‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù) and past consumption trends.
5. Manual chemical engineering controls:
   - **Mild-steel tanks** for storage (special care for XP fuels due to high-octane additives).
   - **Activated carbon filters** for vapor recovery.
   - **Manual thermal regulation** using valves.
   - **Periodic sludge cleaning** in carbon-based tanks.
   - **ASTM D86/D93 tests** for quality compliance.

**Key Problems:**
- No predictive demand forecasting.
- Thermal and vaporization losses.
- Delayed replenishment or overfilling.
- Sludge contamination and corrosion risk.
- Lack of automated quality tracking.

## üí° Proposed Solution
- **IoT-enabled tank sensors** for real-time monitoring and alerts.
- **Predictive demand modeling** using ARIMA, LSTM, and seasonal factors.
- **Dashboard analytics** for fuel flow, demand prediction, and KPIs.
- **GPS-based delivery tracking** for accurate ETAs.
- **Maintenance alerts** for vapor recovery filters and sludge cleaning.
- Digital logging of **ASTM quality test results**.

---

## üìä Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Fuel Stockouts < **10%**
- Dispatch lead time < **48 hours**
- On-time PO Delivery > **90%**
- Tank temperature alert at **45¬∞C (MS)**
- Sludge accumulation rate ‚â§ **7%**
- Positive system adoption feedback via surveys
