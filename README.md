# IOCL-fuel-order-Analytics-
## Project Overview 
Developed an interactive dashboard based on MS Excel and My SQL , which analyzes fuel transportation data from Petrol Pumps across Jabalpur
region for Indian Oil corporation Ltd. 

## Tools & Technologies 
1. **Microsoft Excel**- A spreadsheet tool for data storage, cleaning and analysis.
2. **SQL(MySQL)**- For data storing, querying and manipulating data.
3. **Power Query**- For data transforming and cleaning.
4. **DAX**-For creating calculated fields via Power Pivot
5. **Pivot Charts**- For visualization of Pivot tables analyzing trends. 


## Key Objectives

- Analyze PO trends and fuel dispatch timelines
- Identify pumps with frequent delays or large quantity orders
- Build dynamic dashboards for drill-down analysis
- Automate cleaning of inconsistent date formats and values

## SQL highlights

- Key Questions, Answered 
1. What is the total fuel quantity ordered (in KL) for each product type across all pumps?
2. How much total fuel quantity and revenue was generated for each product type at different locations?
3. Which petrol pumps have the highest total sales, and how do they rank based on the amount spent?
4. What is the average quantity ordered for XP95 fuel by each pump where payment is already completed?
5. When did each petrol pump place their first recorded order, and what was the total revenue generated since then?
6. Was the dispatch delayed, early, or quick compared to the PO date for each order?
7. What is the month-over-month percentage change in quantity ordered for each petrol pump?
8. What are each petrol pump's name, owner's name, operating hours, total fuel ordered, and the number of fuel types they ordered?

## Insights 

- Consistent Fuel Demand Across Pumps
All petrol pumps display nearly equal fuel quantities ordered, indicating a balanced supply distribution across the region.

- May 2025 Recorded a Spike in Fuel Orders
A significant increase in total amount ordered was observed in May 2025 compared to April 2025.

- XYZ Petroleum Leads in Sales
XYZ Petroleum ranks highest in total sales, indicating strong demand or larger capacity at this pump.

- Owner-Wise Operating Hours Remain Uniform
Most pump owners operate within a narrow range of average hours, suggesting standardized shift patterns.

- Chhindwara and Katni Show High Fuel Revenue
These locations consistently record higher total amounts across all fuel types, highlighting high consumption or strategic importance.

- Minimal Fuel Dispatch Delays
Average delay days across all pumps range between ~2.9 to 3.1 days, reflecting an efficient dispatch system.

- XP95 and MS (Petrol) Are Most Popular Fuels
These fuel types are ordered more frequently across multiple pumps, reflecting higher demand.

- Fuel Diversity Exists at Larger Pumps
Pumps with higher total orders also show a higher number of fuel types received, indicating wider operational scope.


### **Conclusion**

The fuel tracking dashboard for Jabalpur reveals a well-managed and balanced fuel distribution network. Key petrol pumps such as XYZ Petroleum and SpeedWay Fuels lead in sales and quantity, indicating their central role in regional fuel supply. Most pumps exhibit minimal dispatch delays and consistent operating hours, reflecting logistical efficiency. Additionally, XP95 and MS (Petrol) emerge as the most in-demand fuel types. Location-wise trends highlight Chhindwara and Katni as major consumption hubs. These insights can help optimize supply strategies, improve inventory planning, and enhance operational decision-making across IOCLâ€™s network.
